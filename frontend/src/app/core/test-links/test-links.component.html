      This website was built as part of a Ph.D. by <a href="https://wwww.shanemcgarry.com" target="_blank">Shane A. McGarry</a>.
      The aim of this site is to collect information about how individuals utilise various search mechanisms such as keyword
      searches or data visualisations. If you have a login, it is because you have agreed to participate in this study. If you'd

    <h3>Experiment Details</h3>
    <p>
      As a participant in this experiment, you will be provided with a task worksheet that will guide you through a few questions
      that you will answer using the tools in this website. Prior to the start of the exercise,  you will be asked to fill up
      a short pre-test questionnaire that will help us gauge your comfort level with technology. You will be randomly assigned
      into one of two groups. For the first hour, you will be working with either the keyword search or the visualisation
      search to answer the questions in the task worksheet. Once you complete the task worksheet, you will then fill out a short
      post-test questionnaire describing your experience with the particular version of search you employed. For the second
      hour, you will switch modes and use the other form of search to complete the task worksheet. Like the first hour, you
      will then fill up the post-test questionnaire in order to describe your experience with the mode of search you used.
